/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the HealthFlow application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset employs a strict user-ownership model for user profiles
 * and denormalized authorization checks for appointments and reviews.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores patient/employee profile data. Access is restricted to the owner.
 * - /appointments/{appointmentId}: Stores appointment data with denormalized patientId and doctorId for authorization.
 * - /reviews/{reviewId}: Stores review data with denormalized hospitalId and patientId for authorization.
 * - /employees/{employeeId}: Stores employee data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile data.
 * - Appointments and Reviews are accessible only to associated patients and doctors.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The 'appointments' and 'reviews' collections denormalize user IDs ('patientId', 'doctorId', 'hospitalId')
 * directly onto the documents. This avoids costly `get()` calls during authorization.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * User profiles and appointments are stored in separate top-level collections to
 * maintain a clear separation of concerns and simplify security rules.
